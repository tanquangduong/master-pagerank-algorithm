`conda create -n env_name python=3.10`\
`conda activate env_name`
- Create Python environment\
`pip install -r .\path_to_requirements\requirements.txt`


## ✅ PageRank Algorithm
The PageRank algorithm was initially used by Google to rank the search results of a user query.
It generates a number that quantifies the importance of search results in the context of 
the query the user has executed. 
This was designed by two Ph.D. students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, 
at Stanford in the late 1990s, who also went on to start Google. \
What we will do in this notebook:
- Simulate webpage
- Simulate network
- Plot network connection
- Calculate transition matrix to know the probability value for the connection from one node to another
